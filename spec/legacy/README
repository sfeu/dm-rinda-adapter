This directory contains the old specs, written for 0.1.0. They are retained
here while the specs are separated into spec/{public,semipublic}.

Examples marked as @done indicate those for which there are equivalents in
spec/{public,semipublic}. Once all specs are moved (or rewritten, as
appropriate), the legacy specs will be removed.
